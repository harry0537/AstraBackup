# Project Astra NZ

An autonomous navigation system for agricultural and research applications using ArduPilot and modern sensor technologies.

## Overview

This project develops autonomous rover capabilities using ArduPilot firmware with integrated LiDAR and depth camera systems. The platform is designed for precision operation in orchard environments and agricultural settings.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Navigation**: ArduPilot-based flight control with waypoint missions
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Real-time detection using LiDAR and depth cameras
- **Row Following**: Precision agriculture navigation for orchard operations
- **Remote Monitoring**: WiFi telemetry with Mission Planner integration
- **Sensor Fusion**: Multi-modal sensor integration for robust operation

## Hardware Platform

- **Flight Controller**: Pixhawk 6C with ArduPilot Rover firmware
- **LiDAR**: SLAMTEC RPLidar S3 for 360Â° obstacle detection
- **Depth Camera**: Intel RealSense for forward obstacle avoidance
- **Companion Computer**: Ubuntu-based system for sensor processing
- **Communication**: MAVLink over WiFi for ground station connectivity

## Applications

- **Orchard Automation**: Autonomous navigation between crop rows with cloud monitoring
- **Agricultural Surveying**: Precision mapping and monitoring with real-time data upload
- **Fleet Management**: Multi-vehicle coordination via AWS Mission Control Server
- **Research Platforms**: Configurable autonomous vehicle testbed with cloud analytics
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Automated data collection with remote cloud access

## System Architecture

The system combines ArduPilot's proven autopilot capabilities with modern sensor technologies. A companion computer processes LiDAR and camera data, converting it to MAVLink messages for the flight controller. This enables sophisticated obstacle avoidance while maintaining the reliability of ArduPilot's navigation algorithms.

## Getting Started
